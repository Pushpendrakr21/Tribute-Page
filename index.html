            <h2>About Marie Curie</h2>
            <p>Marie Skłodowska Curie was a Polish and naturalized-French physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, and remains the only person to win Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields.
                When she was ten years old, Maria began attending the boarding school of J. Sikorska; next, she attended a gymnasium for girls, from which she graduated on 12 June 1883 with a gold medal.[14] After a collapse, possibly due to depression,[15] she spent the following year in the countryside with relatives of her father, and the next year with her father in Warsaw, where she did some tutoring.[14] Unable to enroll in a regular institution of higher education because she was a woman, she and her sister Bronisława became involved with the clandestine Flying University (sometimes translated as Floating University), a Polish patriotic institution of higher learning that admitted women students.[14][15]


Krakowskie Przedmiescie 66, Warsaw, where Maria did her first scientific work, 1890–91
Maria made an agreement with her sister, Bronisława, that she would give her financial assistance during Bronisława's medical studies in Paris, in exchange for similar assistance two years later.[14][22] In connection with this, Maria took a position first as a home tutor in Warsaw, then for two years as a governess in Szczuki with a landed family, the Żorawskis, who were relatives of her father.[14][22] While working for the latter family, she fell in love with their son, Kazimierz Żorawski, a future eminent mathematician.[22] His parents rejected the idea of his marrying the penniless relative, and Kazimierz was unable to oppose them.[22] Maria's loss of the relationship with Żorawski was tragic for both. He soon earned a doctorate and pursued an academic career as a mathematician, becoming a professor and rector of Kraków University. Still, as an old man and a mathematics professor at the Warsaw Polytechnic, he would sit contemplatively before the statue of Maria Skłodowska that had been erected in 1935 before the Radium Institute, which she had founded in 1932

        <h2>Scientific Contributions</h2>
        <p>Marie Curie's work laid the groundwork for the development of the X-ray machine. She also discovered the elements polonium and radium. Her contributions to science and her pioneering efforts for women in the field continue to inspire generations.
            Following Henri Becquerel’s discovery (1896) of a new phenomenon (which she later called “radioactivity”), Marie decided to find out if the property discovered in uranium was to be found in other matter. She discovered that this was true for thorium at the same time as Gerhard Carl Schmidt did. Turning her attention to minerals, she found her interest drawn to pitchblende. Pitchblende, a mineral whose activity is superior to that of pure uranium, could be explained only by the presence in the ore of small quantities of an unknown substance of very high activity. Pierre then joined Marie in the work that she had undertaken to resolve this problem and that led to the discovery of the new elements, polonium and radium. Pierre devoted himself chiefly to the physical study of the new radiations. In 1902 Marie succeeded in isolating one-tenth of a gram of radium chloride that was entirely free from barium. Scientists soon recognized the importance of this work. In 1903 Marie , Pierre, and Becquerel shared the Nobel Prize in Physics. Marie was the first woman to win the Nobel Prize in any subject. Pure radium alone was not isolated until 1910 by Marie with the help of chemist André-Louis Debierne, one of Pierre’s pupils. The radioactivity of pure radium proved to be more than one million times as great as that of either uranium or thorium. In 1911 Marie was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry, for the isolation of pure radium
